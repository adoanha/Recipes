        <h2>Why Should You Cook?</h2>
        <p>There are many values and aspects of food. One's culture and traditions heavily influences the way food is made. One may view it as a form of art waiting patiently to be consumed.
            Or one may just have a practical view and just see food as sustenance. No matter the reason, food is a heavy component of our life! I mean, we need it to survive (although you could last
            a good while without eating for a month). You probably eat 2,000 calories more or less -- multiples meals are eaten by most people everyday. If you're eating that much, you may want to
            give a go at cooking because heck you might enjoy it. You'll not only please yourself, but you're be pleasing your loved ones as well. It's honestly the best way to tell someone you love
            them without even saying it!
